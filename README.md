Any Machine Learning or Deep learning project involves different stages:
1. Understanding the business problem statement.
2. Data collection (can be collected from web scrapping, clients, databases etc.)
3. Identifying the task (Regression/Classification/Clustering).
4. Classification task (binary/multi class)
5. What algorithms can be used? (classification - Logistics regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM etc).
6. Model performance on the unseen data.
7. Model deployment
